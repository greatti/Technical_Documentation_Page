Hello! 
This is one more project, a much simpler one, that works just like a informative page with topics, each topic with its own paragraphs and subtopics. Furthermore, we create a fixed navigation bar with a title and all the topics present on the main page, and when you click in one of them, you are taken to the part of the webpage with the same topic. 
It is a layout for those who want to train basic CSS and HTML, as well as the 'Forms' and 'Tribute page' and, therefore, it has a lot of freedom to modify and explore new knowledge, you wont spend much time reading the code because its pretty intuitive.
