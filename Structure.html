				<article>
					<p>In a few words, github is a platform for the development of group projects. Hub is a word used to indicate a platform that connects computers to a network to share information</p>
					<p>Github is also available for companies, that one is called GitHub Enterprise, where we find a intelligent wat to manage group work.</p>
					<p>
						The best thing in Github is that a lot of people of the group can work the same project at the same time in their own computer, all around the world, without necessarily compromising the original work, that is, modifying it as a "suggestion"
					</p>
					<p>
						To create your account, enter GitHub and fill in the requested data - name, email and password. In a few minutes, you will receive a confirmation email to start using the platform.

					<p>Github have some functions to facilitate your work, some of them you can read below: </p>
					<ol>
  					    <li>README     
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>Is the first impression one would have about a project or profile. Its a set of information necessary for readers to understand, it works like a manual writen in Markdown that we'll see later.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
  					    <li>Repository 
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can discuss and manage your project's work within the repository. You can own repositories individually, or you can share ownership of repositories with other people in an organization.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>                
                        <li>Projects
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>It is also one of the Resource in Git Repository and main use of it is to manage the projects with a visual board. If you create a project in Git Repository it create a visual board like a Kanban board to manage the project.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
						<li>Branch     
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>A branch is a copy of a repository. You can use it to develop your project individually, without changing the original directory. Thus, only after it is finalized, will it be combined again with the original repository.</li>
						        <li>Essa função é útil, por exemplo, se você tem mais de uma opção para a finalização de um projeto. Você pode testar as opções separadamente e incluir o código definitivo só quando você decidir qual alternativa é a melhor.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
						<li>Pull Request     
    					    <ol>
      					        <li>A Pull Request is when you inform other members of your team that you are going to incorporate your branch into the original repository. Team collaborators may or may not accept the Pull Request.</li>
    					    </ol>
  					    </li>
					</ol>
